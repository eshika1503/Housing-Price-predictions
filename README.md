# Housing-Price-predictions
The goal is to build a model to forecast the price of houses. The dataset is pre-processed by analysing the missing values. The various  
algorithms are used to predict the price of housing like-
LinearRegression
Decision tree
RandomForestRegressor
at the last we also test the model and check the usage of it.
